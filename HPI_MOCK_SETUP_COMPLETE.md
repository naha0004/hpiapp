### 🎯 **How to Test Right Now**

#### **Option 1: Use the Main HPI Section**
1. Go to your HPI Checks page
2. Enter ANY registration (e.g., "TEST123", "AB12CDE")
3. Click "Run Check"
4. Wait 1.5 seconds (simulated API delay)
5. See comprehensive data with "View Comprehensive Report" button

#### **Option 2: Quick Test**
Add this to any page to test immediately:
```tsx
import QuickHPITest from '@/components/quick-hpi-test'

// Then in your JSX:
<QuickHPITest />
```

### 🔧 **Easy Switch to Real API**

When you get your real OneAuto API working, just change ONE line in `/lib/oneauto.ts`:

```typescript
// Change this line:
const useMock = process.env.ONEAUTOAPI_USE_MOCK === 'true' || true

// To this:
const useMock = process.env.ONEAUTOAPI_USE_MOCK === 'true'
```

Or set `ONEAUTOAPI_USE_MOCK=false` in your `.env` file.

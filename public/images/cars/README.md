# Car Images Directory

This directory contains fallback and placeholder images for vehicles.

## Structure:
- `generic-car.jpg` - Default car placeholder
- `placeholder-vehicle.jpg` - Alternative placeholder
- Make-specific folders for organized images

## Usage:
The CarImageService will use these as fallback images when API sources are unavailable.

## Adding Images:
1. Add make-specific folders (ford, vauxhall, bmw, etc.)
2. Add model-specific images
3. Use consistent naming: `make_model_year.jpg` or `make_model.jpg`
4. Recommended size: 800x600 pixels for primary images, 200x150 for thumbnails

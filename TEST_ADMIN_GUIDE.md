# ðŸ§ª Test Admin Panel - Quick Guide

## Test Credentials Set Up

I've added test credentials to your system:

**Test Admin Email:** `test@admin.com`  
**Test Admin Phone:** `+447123456789`

## How to Test

### Option 1: Test with NextAuth Email Sign-in

1. **Start your app:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Go to sign-in page:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click sign-in

3. **Sign in with test email:**
   - Use email: `test@admin.com`
   - (You'll need to configure email provider or use another method)

4. **Access admin panel:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
   - You should see the full admin dashboard!

### Option 2: Test by Temporarily Bypassing Auth (Quick Test)

If you want to test the admin panel UI immediately without setting up full auth, let me know and I can create a temporary bypass for testing purposes.

## What You'll See

âœ… **User Management Tab** - Search, filter, activate/deactivate users  
âœ… **Analytics Tab** - Dashboard with user stats, revenue, appeals  
âœ… **Full Admin Controls** - All admin functionality available  

## After Testing

Once you've tested and confirmed it works:

1. **Replace test credentials** with your real email/phone in `.env.local`
2. **Set up proper NextAuth providers** (Google, email, etc.)
3. **Remove test credentials** for security

## Current Test Setup

- âœ… Test credentials added to `.env.local`
- âœ… Admin authentication configured
- âœ… Full admin panel ready to test
- âœ… All security features active

**Ready to test your admin panel!** ðŸš€

  /**
   * Analyze legal grounds for the appeal
On ${issueDate}, my vehicle suffered an unexpected and complete mechanical breakdown at ${location}, rendering it immobile and requiring immediate professional recovery assistance. The breakdown created exceptional circumstances that provide lawful justification for the vehicle's position.

**Statutory Framework:**
• Road Traffic Act 1988, Section 170 (duty in case of accident)
• Highway Code, Rules 274-275 (broken down vehicles)
• Common law doctrine of inevitable accident

**Evidential Support:**
The mechanical failure was:
• Sudden and without warning
• Complete, preventing vehicle movement
• Requiring professional recovery services
• Documented through recovery service records

**Legal Precedent:**
*R v Spurge* [1961] 2 QB 205 established that mechanical breakdown creating impossibility of compliance provides lawful excuse. The principle of *nemo tenetur ad impossibile* (no one is bound to do the impossible) applies directly to these circumstances.`

    } else if (reason.includes('payment') || reason.includes('machine')) {
      description += `**1. PAYMENT SYSTEM MALFUNCTION - IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPLIANCE (Primary Ground)**

The PCN was issued despite my genuine attempts to comply with payment requirements, which were frustrated by the operator's defective payment infrastructure.

**Legal Position:**
On ${issueDate}, I attempted to make payment for parking at ${location} but was prevented from doing so by the malfunctioning payment system. This created a situation of impossibility, where compliance with parking requirements became objectively impossible through no fault of my own.

**Statutory Authority:**
• Consumer Rights Act 2015, Sections 49-57 (services to be performed with reasonable care and skill)
• Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977
• Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982

**Contractual Analysis:**
The operator's failure to maintain functional payment systems constitutes a fundamental breach of their service obligations. Under established contract law principles (*Hadley v Baxendale* [1854]), I cannot be held liable for consequences arising from the operator's breach of their primary obligations.

**Legal Doctrine:**
The principle of *impossibilium nulla obligatio est* (there is no obligation to do impossible things) provides complete defense against penalty charges where the operator's own failures prevent compliance.`

    } else if (reason.includes('loading') || reason.includes('unloading')) {
      description += `**1. PERMITTED LOADING/UNLOADING OPERATIONS (Primary Ground)**

The vehicle was engaged in lawful loading/unloading activities specifically permitted under the applicable traffic regulations and local authority guidelines.

**Legal Position:**
On ${issueDate}, I was conducting legitimate loading/unloading operations at ${location} within the parameters of the permitted time limits and operational requirements. These activities are specifically exempted from standard parking restrictions under established traffic management provisions.

**Regulatory Framework:**
• Traffic Management Act 2004, Schedule 7
• Local authority traffic regulation orders
• Highway Code provisions relating to loading/unloading

**Operational Evidence:**
The loading/unloading activity was:
• Genuine and necessary for legitimate business/domestic purposes
• Conducted within permitted time limits
• Carried out with due consideration for other road users
• In compliance with all applicable restrictions and guidelines

**Legal Authority:**
*Attorney General v Bastow* [1957] established that genuine loading operations constitute lawful use of the highway. The activities undertaken fell squarely within the statutory exemptions provided for such operations.`

    } else {
      description += `**1. NO CONTRAVENTION OCCURRED / EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES (Primary Ground)**

Upon careful examination of the facts and applicable law, I submit that either no contravention of parking regulations occurred, or that exceptional circumstances exist that warrant the cancellation of this PCN.

**Legal Position:**
The circumstances surrounding the alleged contravention on ${issueDate} at ${location} do not support the issuance of a valid penalty charge notice. The enforcement action appears to be fundamentally flawed either procedurally or substantively.

**Procedural Requirements:**
Under the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General Regulations 2007, the enforcement authority must establish:
• That a contravention actually occurred
• Compliance with all procedural requirements
• Proper service of the penalty charge notice
• Adherence to statutory time limits and procedures

**Burden of Proof:**
The burden rests entirely with the enforcement authority to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that a valid contravention occurred. This burden cannot be discharged in the present circumstances given the factual matrix of the case.`
    }

    description += `

**PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS:**

**Notice Requirements:**
This representation is submitted within the statutory time limit prescribed under regulation 4 of the Civil Enforcement Regulations. I hereby exercise my statutory right to challenge this PCN and request its immediate cancellation.

**Evidence and Documentation:**
I am prepared to provide additional supporting evidence and documentation as may be required to substantiate this appeal. All relevant materials will be made available upon request.

**Administrative Review:**
This matter should be resolved at the administrative stage without the necessity for adjudication proceedings. The legal and factual grounds outlined above clearly demonstrate that the PCN cannot be sustained.

**CONCLUSION AND RELIEF SOUGHT:**

For the reasons set out above, both in law and in fact, I respectfully submit that this PCN has been issued in error and should be cancelled immediately. The enforcement authority is requested to:

1. Cancel the PCN in its entirety
2. Confirm cancellation in writing
3. Remove any associated records from enforcement databases
4. Take no further action in respect of this matter

I trust that this matter will receive your urgent attention and look forward to confirmation of the PCN's cancellation within the statutory timeframe.

**DECLARATION:**

I believe that the facts stated in this representation are true. I understand that proceedings for contempt of court may be brought against anyone who makes, or causes to be made, a false statement in a document verified by a statement of truth without an honest belief in its truth.

Yours faithfully,
